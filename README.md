# Dyskinesia

My sway window manager config, tuned for my Parkinson's, heavily "why" commented, unusual features.

2025-04-13 Over the last week I have been populating github slowly starting with the config file itself. It needed some scripts and some assets bringing over. There is now enough for someone familiar with sway to replicate my configuration, In the next week I expect to git clone this repo, check everything is in place, fix some details, and then baseline and release.
